Keys and Certificate for making gRPC-connection between Login(server) and WebApi(client) possible

Detailed description 
https://snyk.io/blog/building-a-secure-api-with-grpc/

Keys and cers should be generated by generate-certs.sh
Needs openssl installed.
I used WSL to generate in manually from cli. 

After all is done for client: 

1.
const credentials = grpc.credentials.createSsl(
   fs.readFileSync('../certs/ca.crt'),
   fs.readFileSync('../certs/client.key'),
   fs.readFileSync('../certs/client.crt')
);

2. 
const client = new EventService("localhost:50051",credentials);

for server: 

1. 
let credentials = grpc.ServerCredentials.createSsl(
   fs.readFileSync('./certs/ca.crt'), [{
   cert_chain: fs.readFileSync('./certs/server.crt'),
   private_key: fs.readFileSync('./certs/server.key')
}], true);

2. 
server.bindAsync("0.0.0.0:50051", credentials, (error, port) => {
console.log(`Server listening at http://0.0.0.0:${port}`);
server.start();
});
